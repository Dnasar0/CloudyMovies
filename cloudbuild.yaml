        # Therefore, you do NOT need to run `gcloud secrets access` here.

        # Execute your deployment script. The secrets (DB_USER_ACCOUNT, etc.)
        # will already be available as environment variables to cloudbuild.sh.

# CORRECT WAY to make secrets available to steps via 'availableSecrets'
availableSecrets:
  secretManager:
  # For each secret, specify the full version name (or 'latest') and the
  # environment variable name it should be available as in your build step.
  - versionName: projects/255467220069/secrets/account-mongo-user/versions/latest
    env: DB_USER_ACCOUNT # This will be the environment variable name in your step
  - versionName: projects/255467220069/secrets/account-mongo-pass/versions/latest
    env: DB_PASS_ACCOUNT
  - versionName: projects/255467220069/secrets/movie-mongo-user/versions/latest
    env: DB_USER_MOVIE
  - versionName: projects/255467220069/secrets/movie-mongo-pass/versions/latest
